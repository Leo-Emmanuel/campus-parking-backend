## 1. INTRODUCTION

The Campus Parking App is designed to streamline the parking experience within a campus environment. It aims to provide users with a convenient way to find, book, and manage parking spaces, while also offering administrators tools to efficiently manage parking resources.

### 1.1 SCOPE
The scope of this project includes the development of a mobile application for end-users (students, staff) and a backend system for managing parking zones, bookings, events, and user authentication. The application will support features such as real-time parking availability, booking management, push notifications, and potentially QR code-based access.

### 1.2 OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the Campus Parking App are:
*   To provide an intuitive and easy-to-use mobile interface for parking space discovery and booking.
*   To enable efficient management of parking zones and real-time occupancy updates.
*   To implement a secure user authentication and authorization system.
*   To facilitate seamless booking and payment processes.
*   To deliver timely notifications regarding parking status and events.
*   To enhance the overall parking experience on campus for both users and administrators.

## 2. PROOF OF CONCEPT

### 2.1 EXISTING SYSTEM
Currently, campus parking systems may rely on traditional methods such as manual patrolling, physical passes, or basic automated gates. These systems often suffer from inefficiencies, lack of real-time information, and inconvenience for users trying to find available spots. Challenges include congestion, difficulty in locating vacant spaces, and time-consuming administrative processes.

### 2.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed Campus Parking App aims to overcome the limitations of existing systems by introducing a smart, digital solution. It will leverage mobile technology to provide real-time parking information, allow advanced booking, and automate various parking management tasks. The system will reduce manual intervention, improve user convenience, and optimize parking resource utilization.

### 2.3 OBJECTIVES
The objectives for the proof of concept phase are to:
*   Demonstrate the feasibility of real-time parking availability updates.
*   Validate the core booking functionality, including selection and reservation.
*   Showcase user authentication and basic profile management.
*   Illustrate the integration of push notifications for critical updates.
*   Prove the system's ability to reduce parking-related frustrations on campus.

### 3.2 SYSTEM DESIGN INTRODUCTION
*[Content to be added]*

#### 3.2.1 MODULES
The system is composed of several modules designed to manage different aspects of the campus parking system.

**Backend Modules:**
*   **Authentication:** Handles user registration, login, and session management.
*   **User Management:** Manages user profiles and roles (e.g., student, staff, admin).
*   **Parking Zone Management:** Manages parking zone details, availability, and configurations.
*   **Booking Management:** Facilitates parking space booking, payment, and cancellation.
*   **Event Management:** Manages events and associated parking.
*   **Notification System:** Sends push notifications to users for booking updates, reminders, and alerts.
*   **PDF Generation:** Generates booking confirmations or other reports in PDF format.
*   **QR Code Generation:** Generates QR codes for parking access and verification.

**Frontend Modules (Mobile Application):**
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** User login, registration, and role-based access.
*   **Dashboard/Home:** Overview of parking status, upcoming bookings, and quick actions.
*   **Parking Zone Viewer:** Displays available parking zones, real-time occupancy, and navigation.
*   **Booking Interface:** Allows users to search, select, and book parking slots.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration:** Handles secure payment processing for bookings.
*   **Notification Center:** Displays in-app notifications and alerts.
*   **QR Code Scanner/Display:** For scanning parking entry/exit or displaying booking QR codes.
*   **User Profile:** Manages user information and preferences.

#### 3.2.2 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The Campus Parking App follows a client-server architecture, comprising a mobile frontend application and a robust backend API.

*   **Frontend (Client-side):** Developed using React Native, the mobile application provides the user interface for interaction. It communicates with the backend API via HTTP requests to perform operations such as user authentication, booking parking slots, and receiving notifications.
*   **Backend (Server-side):** Built with Node.js and Express.js, the backend serves as the central hub for business logic, data storage, and external service integrations. It exposes RESTful APIs consumed by the frontend.
*   **Database:** MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database to store application data, including user information, parking zone details, booking records, and event data.
*   **Push Notification Service:** Utilizes Expo's push notification service to deliver real-time alerts and updates to users.
*   **WebSockets:** Employs WebSockets for real-time communication, potentially for live parking availability updates or instant notifications.

The interaction flow is as follows:
1.  Users interact with the mobile frontend application.
2.  The frontend sends requests to the backend API.
3.  The backend processes the requests, interacts with the MongoDB database, and potentially external services (e.g., payment gateways, push notification services).
4.  The backend sends responses back to the frontend, which then updates the UI accordingly.

#### 3.2.3 MODELS USED
The backend utilizes the following Mongoose models to interact with the MongoDB database:

*   `User`: Represents user information, including authentication credentials, roles, and personal details.
*   `ParkingZone`: Stores details about different parking areas, such as location, capacity, and availability.
*   `Booking`: Records parking reservations made by users, including booking time, duration, and associated parking zone.
*   `Event`: Manages information about campus events that might affect parking availability.
*   `Notification`: Stores notification details to be sent to users.

#### 3.2.4 DATASET/DATABASE
The project uses **MongoDB** as its primary NoSQL database. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

The database stores collections for:
*   Users
*   Parking Zones
*   Bookings
*   Events
*   Notifications

#### 3.2.5 LANGUAGES
The project primarily uses the following programming languages and frameworks:

*   **Backend:**
    *   **JavaScript (Node.js):** For server-side logic and API development.
    *   **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   **JavaScript (React Native):** For building the cross-platform mobile application.
    *   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   **XML (Android Manifests):** For Android-specific configurations.
